<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yuanhang Zhou. I am currently a doctoral student with the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), under the supervision of [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/index.html).

I received my M. Eng. from Southeast University (SEU), advisor: [Prof. Fei Tong](https://fei-tong.github.io/). I received my B. Eng. from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(NJUPT), advisor: [Prof. Jia Xu](https://xujia-njupt.github.io/xujia.github.io/).

I'm excited about potential collaborations and am always open to discussing new ideas. Please feel free to reach out to me directly via email.
